# Minesweeper

## About the kata

The goal of Minesweeper is to uncover all the squares on a board that do not contain mines without being "blown up" by clicking on a square with a mine underneath.  
To help the player, the game shows a number in a square (hint) which tells the player how many mines there are adjacent to that square.
